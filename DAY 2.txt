Database (XL) Table and Salesforce : 
__________________________________

Table - Object 
Row   -  Record     ________
Column - Field    |
Data   - Value

we need to create object then we create fields and with help of fields we can create records. 
--------------------
what is object ? 
- Object is similar to a database table in Force.com platform. 
- The platform comes with many standard objects like : Account, Contact, Case, Lead, Opportunity, etc.
- Standard objects support default apps like Sales and Service. 
- We can also create Custom objects as per the project. 
---------------------

BACKEND VIEWING of objects :

Login in SF - Under Setup in OBJECT MANAGER we can see Standard objects - there TYPE is also mentioned as Standard Object - and there API NAME is Provided - this is viewing from backend of the application. 

FRONT END VIEWING of objects : 

If we want to view from the frontend we have to write the application name in search as Sales/ Service and we see the TABS and inside we also see its record. this is frontend viewing. 

-----------------------

Standard vs Custom Objects : 
           
                          Standard                Custom 

Label                  Account                  Student 
Plural Label       Accounts                Students 
API Name           Account                 Student__c 

3 things to keep in mind wrt Std and Custome objects : 

Lable means name of the object. 
Plural Label is used for Name of the Tab. 
API name is unique name for the object. 
api - ref obj in another tools like flow and apex. 

---------------------------------- 

TABS - 
two tabs - std and console navigation
home page of that particular tab appears - account tab click we can see account record
