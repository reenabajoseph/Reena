1. Introduction to salesforce.

what is salesforce ?
-it is cloud based CRM
- salesforce is used to automate the business process. 
- it is used for organized and unorganized (business) 
- it can be sales process, service process, hospital, school, 
b2b cloud, b2c cloud, and also customize the unorganized business. 
----------------------
Application / website is created by frontend and backend.
what is Server ? 
which IT company holds access to banking segment in india ? Infosys. 
International websites, passport website, protocols - TCS

inside application we have production and Sandbox or Testing environment.

login.salesforce.com - Production
Test.salesforce.com - Sandbox (Testing Environment) 

what is Production ? 
live application that people see.

what is Sandbox ?
- Sandbox is copy of live env of production. Any changes req in app is done here. 
Server is made low and whole companies website is not stopped but just the 
section where changes were required, there the server is made slow. 
- we can create multiple sand box( login pwd) under 1 production. 

Devops engineer's job is changes are pushed from testing to live, they integrate. 

----------------------------------------------

gobal IP Ranges 

go to Profiles - login IP ranges - 

IP ? how it works ? 
restriction - you can open this software only here and in this devices they work. not anywhere else they are being restricted to work u can only open this app only on this computer and with in this IP ranges 

gobla IP Ranges - i can stay out of country and access the portal no restriction. with IP we can track what we are doing. 
---------------------------------------------

in org - we have lightning and classic 

why company came up with lightning ? 
- UI is faster in lightning than in classic.
why is UI faster ? 
classics loads from server directly but lightning loads form frontend javascript what ever is stored in memory in the backend it will send that first so the work is not stopped the new changes will be updated in few mins. 

what does javascript do ?
how it uploads ? - it takes commands that some changes are created and gives commands to backend that changes have been made - it will take few sec time but since the old data is there in lightning already and it will keep sinking with the new data form backend. 
js - responce is very faster 

solution - we can refresh or change display density to Comfy and Compact and check if new data is sinked and it loads from Server. 

CASH MEMORY - temporary memory which stores data and is in database when loads to show old data.

----------------------------------------------------
- Navigation of Home Page
